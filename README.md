# Animal Culture Database (ACDB)

The **Animal Culture Database (ACDB)** is a comparative database of cultural behaviors across nonhuman animal species. It synthesizes current literature on intra-species behavioral variation in contexts such as communication, foraging, and migration into a relational database accessible through an open-access Shiny app.

## Overview

The **ACDB** aims to:

- **Document socially transmitted behaviors**: Record instances of cultural behaviors observed in wild animal populations.
- **Analyze cultural diversity**: Examine patterns of cultural diversity globally and across different species.
- **Inform conservation research**: Incorporate knowledge of socially transmitted behaviors to better inform biodiversity conservation policies.

## Features

- **Interactive map**: Visualize the geographic distribution of recorded populations with cultural behaviors.
- **Search and filter**: Search and filter data by species, behavior types, transmission modes, and other variables.
- **Data access**: Download current data tables for further analysis.
- **Data contribution**: Submit new data through a standardized form and guidelines.


## Usage

1. **Explore the map**: Navigate the interactive world map to view recorded populations and their cultural behaviors.
2. **Search and filter**: Use the search functionality to find specific species or behaviors of interest.
3. **Download data**: Access the "Download Data" section to download data tables in CSV format.
4. **Contribute data**: Follow the guidelines in the "Contribute" section to submit new data for inclusion in the database.
